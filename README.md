# Github Profile Recreation

###This project was to recreate my Github Repo profile.

###The project was built in week 4 using jQuery AJAX requests along with bootstrap and handlebars to display the information.

For this project I had to use the Github API to pull in information from my actual Github Profile and use that information to recreate the repo tab from my Github page. I started using some asynchronous requests for the first time for this app. Once the data was pulled down I used bootstrap and handlebars to display the data along with javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS to recreate the page.
